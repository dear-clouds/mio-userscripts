# userscripts.js

This is the repo to organize all the userscripts i've created and maintain for various websites/platforms.

You must install a userscript manager before trying to install these or it will not work: [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io)

Usercripts can be updated automatically via the add-on and everything should be available on [Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/548221-dear-clouds).

> [!NOTE]
> I can take requests when I feel like it and they interest me, just open an [new issue](https://github.com/dear-clouds/mio-userscripts/issues/new) with the label request.
